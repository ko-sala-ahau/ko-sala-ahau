- 👋 Hi, I’m @ko-sala-ahau
- 👀 I’m interested in Māori & Indigenous Data and Digital Sovereignty. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the world of programming, lingo etc, and how I can create an indigenous metadata schema. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project that is focussed on indigenising digital spaces from the code and system design. Admittedly I am an utter n00b in this space, but I feel like the technology to recreate and supplement our brain capacity exists...or could. 
- 📫 How to reach me: le.sala.tapui@gmail.com or thesala001@gmail.com
